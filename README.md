Q: How do I add mods to the list?

A: Fork this repository, and change README.MD to include your mod. Once added, go back to the main page of your fork, press contribute, and open a pull request. If people find it fun, it will be added.
You MUST link the mod, and it must have a GameBanana or GameJolt page.
